**TL;DR (if you can't be bothered reading all of the below)** - Fosstodon will wait and see what happens, but if Facebook's new service introduces any privacy issues for our users, we will defederate.

Mike and I have been asked, multiple times, about what Fosstodon's position is on Facebook potentially joining the Fediverse.

If you're not aware, the TL;DR is that Facebook, or their parent company, Meta, is planning to create a Twitter clone that will support ActivityPub ([more here](https://www.lifewire.com/how-metas-new-project-p92-could-deliver-the-killing-blow-to-twitter-7255582)). That means that Facebook, or some semblance of it, **could** be coming to a Mastodon instance near you.

Needless to say, this has a lot of folk on Mastodon a little worried - hence the constant stream of messages to myself and Mike asking what we, as admins of Fosstodon, plan to do about it.

## Fosstodon's position

Truth is, there isn't that much info out there on how this thing will actually work, or what it will be capable of. Lots of people seem to be concerned about Facebook "getting their info". Fact is, they can do that now if they really want to - it would be trivial for Facebook to stand something up that hoovers up all the public data that's on the Fediverse, via API.

And that's the clincher here - **it's all public data**. So the best advice I can give if you're concerned about your data, is lock down your account and don't post publicly.

All that being said, here's what we plan to do **if** this thing ever sees the light of day:
* As a team, we will review what the service is capable of and what advantages/disadvantages such a service will bring to the Fediverse
* We will then make a determination on whether we will defederate that service
* We will **NOT** jump on the bandwagon, or partake in the romour mill that seems to be plaguing the Fediverse at the moment

It's important to say that neither myself or Mike like anything that Facebook stands for. Neither of us use it, and both of us go to great lengths to avoid it when browsing the web. So if this service introduces **any** privacy issues for our users, we will defederate.

However, we don't know what this thing is yet. Hell, we don't even know if this thing will actually *exist* yet. So let's just wait and see.

What if this thing ends up being a service that can allow you to communicate with your friends who still use Facebook, via the Fedi, in a privacy respecting manor. That would be pretty cool, I think; especially when you consider that one of the main concerns with new users on the Fedi is that they can't find their friends.

We all know Facebook is a [privacy vortex of doom](https://kevquirk.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-facebook) so I doubt that would ever happen, but we shall see...
