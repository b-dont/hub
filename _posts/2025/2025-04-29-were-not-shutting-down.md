Hey folks, Kev here. üëãüèª

You may have read the posts that Mike and I wrote yesterday about us both being burned out and wanting to step down. So I wanted to write a quick post here to set the record straight on a couple of things, as there's some inaccurate information flying around as a result of those 2 posts.

If you didn't read them, here's the links:

I've not been checking in on Fosstodon regularly, since I wrote the post as it's overwhelming, but I have seen a few posts from people saying they're moving because Fosstodon is shutting down.

**Fosstodon is NOT shutting down.**

Although we're utterly burned out, Mike and I don't want this to be the end of Fosstodon. We would much rather hand over the batton to someone else in the community to take over and hopefully, do a better job than we did.

We're currently in talks with [Gina](https://fosstodon.org/@Gina/). She's well liked on the instance, is very level headed and used to be a moderator, so she has a good idea of what to expect. Mike and I both trust her implicitly and think she would be a great custodian for Fosstodon 2.0.

To be clear - there's still a lot of conversations to be had, and a lot of stuff to hand over, but our hope is that we will hand the reigns over to Gina, if she still wants it once we've given her a warts-and-all run down of everything that's involved.

Gina has a tough task ahead of her - she will need to find new mods to bolster the existing team, and she will likely need to find at least 1 other admin to help her. If Gina decides it's not for her, Mike and I commited to 3 months of notice before anything happens. So during that time, we will look for someone else who might be interested.

<p class="notice">Please don't email Mike and I offering your services. Although very kind, Mike and I have a specific shortlist of people we know and trust that we would approach.</p>

More to come over the next few days/weeks, but I wanted to reassure everyone that although Mike and I are moving on, it doesn't necessarily mean the end of Fosstodon.
