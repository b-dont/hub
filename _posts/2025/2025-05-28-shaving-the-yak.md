Hi all, Gina here 👋

Hope you’re all well! Just some quick updates. If you’ve never heard the phrase “shaving the yak”, let me introduce you to a concept that has become very familiar since stepping into the admin role at Fosstodon.

## Shaving yaks

Yak shaving describes the phenomenon where a seemingly simple task turns into a series of increasingly complicated, often unrelated tasks. Say you want to write a blog post for hub.fosstodon.org on your personal laptop — but first you need to do another thing, such as [fixing your personal laptop](https://fosstodon.org/@Gina/114584297672268080). And to do that, you need to do yet another thing, like checking if your SSD even works anymore. Before you know it, you're in a field somewhere, shaving a yak. Or in my case, deep in my storage unit digging through my spare toolbox to find my miniature Philips screwdriver. All because I wanted to write a post.

Taking over the admin duties at Fosstodon has involved a fair amount of yak shaving.

## Mod training

First! Mod training is going really well 😊

When I put out the call for moderators, over 40 Fosstodon users responded, and many more offered their technical expertise! The potential mods were invited to fill out a survey to assess their availability, commitment, mod experience, and alignment with Fosstodon’s values. Shout out to our friends at Limesurvey for helping us out. See the [survey screenshot here.](https://hub.fosstodon.org/assets/images/full-survey.png)

From those 42 responses, 23 people joined our Mattermost channel to begin training. Some hadn’t filled out the survey, a few opted out to step up as [admins on their own server](https://toot.community/@support/114519606415733028) 🙌, and others were a better fit for different roles. Thanks again to everyone who offered to help.

Since then, the new mod team has been busy! They’ve:
- Read and discussed the Code of Conduct
- Worked through a new training guide
- Completed 20 example scenarios
- And are discussing anonymized real-world reports this week

As of next week, their introductions will start to appear on hub.fosstodon.org/team/. They’ll move into a trial period where they’ll have full mod privileges, but continue to check in and discuss reports with the team before taking action. From the start, it's been a focus to make sure this team is diverse — not just in identities, but also in time zones, backgrounds, age, and experience levels. I’m very proud of how this team is coming together.

## Admin duties

Meanwhile, I’ve been busy behind the scenes with classic admin tasks. One big thing: I don’t want Fosstodon’s finances to get mixed with my personal finances. If there’s one thing that strikes fear in the heart of a Dutch person, it’s dealing with the Dutch tax agency (*de Belastingdienst*). In order to responsibly take over finances from Kev, it’ll be necessary to set up a separate legal entity for Fosstodon.

Initially I looked into [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/), but they don’t support recurring expenses; meaning Fosstodon’s monthly expenses would still come from my bank account and I’d be reimbursed later. Not a great option.

The alternative is setting up a non-profit. Which again opens a yak-shaving subquest:
- Which bank do we go for? Triodos (Dutch only), or Bunq (international but terrible AI support)?
- Since we don’t have an official address and I don’t want my personal address in our legal statutes, should we use a virtual office address? Or can we use the address of a befriended foundation?

Also, technically I could register the non-profit and open the bank account myself, but ideally we’d have at least one other person involved from the start, for transparency reasons. This means finding a fellow admin. Organizing calls. Doing checks. Sending DMs. Ultimately, more yak shaving. But, it is time.

## 📣 Call for a fellow admin 📣

So hereby a **call for a fellow admin!**

Have you been active on Fosstodon for a while and do you have a few hours per week for the next year to take on admin duties with me? And would you be okay with being registered as a board member for Fosstodon’s non-profit entity? Then send me a DM!

For now, thanks again all for your trust in me :) The yak is practically bald by now, so we’re on the right track. You know where to find me if you have questions or comments!
