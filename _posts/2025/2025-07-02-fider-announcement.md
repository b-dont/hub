We're excited to announce our own [Fider](https://fider.io) instance: [vote.fosstodon.org](https://vote.fosstodon.org)! Fider is a simple feature voting system that will give our community a platform to engage directly with the Fosstodon team and vote on and discuss suggestions and feedback for Fosstodon itself.

This platform is for Fosstodon users only; you can log in directly with your Fosstodon account. We look forward to hearing more feedback from the community to build a more transparent and collaborative platform together!

### Vote.Fosstodon.org Participation Rules

âœ… Basic Participation Rules

1. Be respectful and constructive. Only post suggestions or feedback that contribute positively to the community or server.
2. One idea per post. Keep posts focused so they are easier to vote on and implement.
3. Search before posting. Use the search bar to avoid duplicate ideas or feedback.

ðŸš« Prohibited Content

1. No hate speech, harassment, or discrimination. Posts violating our Code of Conduct will be removed.
2. No personal grievances or call-outs. Vote is for ideas, not interpersonal conflicts or moderation complaints.
3. No spam or self-promotion. This space is not for advertising or off-topic links.

ðŸ§¹ Moderation & Voting

1. Not all top-voted ideas will be implemented. Votes help prioritize, but final decisions rest with the moderation/admin team.
2. Moderators may edit, merge, or remove posts. We may adjust wording for clarity or merge duplicates to keep things clean.
3. Use appropriate tags. Tag your post with categories (e.g., moderation, features, community) to help others navigate.
