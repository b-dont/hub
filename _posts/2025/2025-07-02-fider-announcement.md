We're excited to announce our own [Fider](https://fider.io) instance: [vote.fosstodon.org](https://vote.fosstodon.org)! Fider is a simple feature voting system that will give our community a platform to engage directly with the Fosstodon team and vote on and discuss suggestions and feedback for Fosstodon itself.

This platform is for Fosstodon users only; you can log in directly with your Fosstodon account. We look forward to hearing more feedback from the community to build a more transparent and collaborative platform together!
