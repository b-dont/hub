Hey Fosstodon!

We're excited to announce we've launched our own [Fider](https://fider.io) instance: [vote.fosstodon.org](https://vote.fosstodon.org)! Fider is a simple feature voting tool that our users can use to provide feedback and suggestions for the community and discuss it with the team and other community members.

This service is limited to *our* community members only, and you can login directly from your fosstodon account. We're excited to hear from you in the community, and look forward to the suggestions and feedback you'll provide to us on the platform.
