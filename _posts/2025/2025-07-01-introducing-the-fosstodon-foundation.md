### Introducing the Fosstodon Foundation

Today we are excited to share some news for the open source and decentralized community: the establishment of the Fosstodon Foundation. ðŸ¥³ The foundation is dedicated to fos(s)tering a friendly, inclusive, online space for open source people to come together, exchange ideas, and share common interests.

The newly formed Fosstodon Foundation formalizes this mission, ensuring the community has the legal and organizational structure to grow sustainably. The core objectives include:

- Enabling a safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment for discussions about open-source software, technology, and digital culture.
- Supporting the fediverse by maintaining a community-driven space.
- Providing financial and operational stability through donations, grants, and other funding mechanisms.
- Being a place where like-minded people share with one another in the spirit of open source collaboration. 


### Why a Foundation matters

Foundations play a crucial role in open source and decentralized projects. They provide governance, financial oversight, and legal protection; all of which help communities thrive without relying on corporate ownership. By establishing the Fosstodon Foundation, we are ensuring that:

- Fosstodon remains independent and aligned with its original mission.
- Donations and funding are managed transparently, with clear financial reporting.
- Long-term sustainability is prioritized, so Fosstodon users can happily toot for years to come.


### The near future

The foundationâ€™s board members ([Gina Plat](https://fosstodon.org/@gina), [Kris Freedain](https://fosstodon.org/@krisfreedain), and [Brandon Phillips](https://fosstodon.org/@btp)) will oversee governance, financial management, and strategic direction. 

- Financial accountability: Annual statements will be prepared by the board.
- Responsible governance: As a legally recognized nonprofit, Fosstodon operates under statutes that define our mission, structure, and responsibilities. Amendments to these statutes require a two-thirds majority vote.
- Transparency in dissolution: A foundation means easier continuity. If the foundation should ever wind down, Fosstodon commits itself to a 6 month operational period and will distribute remaining funds among other open source projects.
- Community-driven decisions: More on this very soon!

### Weâ€™re glad youâ€™re here

Weâ€™re very excited that Fosstodon has become an inclusive hub for developers, sysadmins, OSPO-members, community managers, and FOSS enthusiasts. With this new foundation in place, our community is set up for long-term sustainability, and can grow further with stability, transparency, and inclusivity at its core. 

If youâ€™re passionate about open source, decentralized tech, or just want a friendly corner of the internet to discuss nerdy things, we encourage you to check out Fosstodon and consider supporting the foundationâ€™s work. 

Hereâ€™s to the future of our community! ðŸ¥‚
