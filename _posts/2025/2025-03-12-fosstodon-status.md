It's not just you. Fosstodon is currently experiencing technical issues. The issues are a result of an authentication problem with OVH, which handles our object storage. If you'd like to track the issue, you can do so here:

We hope we'll have Fosstoddon back up and running here soon.

We're also aware that our status page is _not_ reflecting the current status of Fosstodon. This outage has pointed out a blind spot in our monitoring. The object storage isn't one of our services, so it's currently unmonitored. Obviously it's having an impact on our service, so we should take that into consideration. 

Thanks for your patience.
