We're very happy to announce that our call for admin has yielded not 1, but 2 very qualified people from our community. Brandon and Kris will be stepping us as admins, together with Gina. They'll introduce themselves in this post.

## An intro from Brandon

Hey everyone, I'm [Brandon](https://fosstodon.org/@btp).

I'll start with a little bit about myself. I'm a 35 year old NOC sys admin from Colorado living with my wonderful life partner and our adorable dog [Millie](https://pixelfed.social/p/bdont/814192090567300607). I'm new to the tech world professionally, getting my current position three years ago, and currently working towards a software developer role. Previously I was a political science major, but never finished my degree. I'd like to get back to school and pivot to a comp sci degree one day. Most of my free time is spent playing ttrpgs, Magic: The Gathering, watching campy sitcoms, or working on personal projects.

Fosstodon is the first instance I joined after creating my first fediverse account on mastodon.social. The passionate and friendly community drew me in, and I've met great pocket friends here that I still chat with today. After Kev and Mike stepped down, I wanted to do my part to keep this community alive and show the rest of the fediverse the welcoming and friendly place Fosstodon really is, and I'm glad that Gina and the rest of the team put their trust me to take on a co-admin role. I hope our users here and across other instances will as well. I'll do my best to not let you down.

I share Gina's vision for Fosstodon as a place for FOSS enthusiasts, tinkerers, hobbyests, and anyone else who's passionate about software and technology to come and share it with the rest of the fediverse and the internet. We also want to continue to make our instance a safer place; to do this, we're going to continue to take good-faith feedback, constructive criticism, and listen to what the users have to say.


## An intro from Kris

Hello friends, I'm [Kris](https://fosstodon.org/@krisfreedain)

A little bit about me. I'm a 51 year old dad living in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon in the beautilful Pacific Northwest. I am dedicated family man, husband, and father, who practices Buddhism and has a daily meditation practice. I enjoy gardening, powerlifting, exploring new places to see and to eat with my family, and supporting our local football/soccer team, the Portland Thorns. 

Professionally, I am the Community Manager for the OpenSearch Project, OpenSearch Software Foundation, and technical steering committee. I've been in the tech world for a long time with experience in community engagement, digital marketing, support, and release management. For the past few years, I've been able to travel the world and meet so many people from the open source community either at conferences or the global user group community we've been building. The open source world is a truly unique place. 

I find connecting people through community to be very fulfilling and the Fosstodon community is a great place to do this. I want to continue to make Fosstodon a safe environment for all of us to meet, to share ideas, and to get to know one another.
