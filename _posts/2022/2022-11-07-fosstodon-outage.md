Hey folks, Kev here from the Fosstodon team.

This is just a quick message to explain to you guys why Fosstodon is down, of all times, during this **MAHOOSIVE** wave of traffic from Twitter.

Well, we're down because we're migrating our database to a new server for a couple of reasons:

* It will give us more room to grow and upgrade the service, keeping the high performance we're known for.
* It will also help Hugo from [Masto.host](https://masto.host) with some much needed relief for other instances on his service.

Basically, we're doing it for the greater good.

{: .notice}
**Note:** We will remain on Masto.host - this is a migration *within* their service.

We estimate that the server will be **down for around 2 hours**, so we should be back online by early-afternoon Eastern. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please feel free to [email us](mailto:mail@fosstodon.org).

Thanks to everyone for the ongoing support. We're really sorry if this outage impacts you negatively, but it really is for the best.
