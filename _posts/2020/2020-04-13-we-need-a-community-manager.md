Fosstodon is growing fast. When we first started back in August 2017, Mike and I were pretty sure that Fosstodon would end up being a niche instance with me, him and maybe a handful of other FOSS enthusiasts.

Fast forward nearly 3 years, we're the largest Linux/Open Source technology instance on the Fediverse, with nearly 9,000 members and growing. Fast.

This is great; Mike and I are so proud of the community we have here on Fosstodon, but as the instance grows, so should our team. We have discussed it and decided **we need a community manager at Fosstodon**.

## What is a community manager?

The term *Community Manager* means different things to different teams. For us, it's someone who can help us grow Fosstodon by keeping the community engaged, interested and wanting more.

But what does that look like? Well, we would expect the Community Manager to be able to come up with interesting posts, challenges, questions & hashtags to engage the community on Fosstodon. We would also like the Community Manager to maintain our Patreon page to make sure our amazing patrons are getting something back from us in exchange for their hard earned cash.

We would also like the Community Manager to manage the donations system so that any additional funding goes to worthy open source projects.

Finally, we want to Community Manager to bring their own ideas - this list is by no means exhaustive. We need someone with a creative mind that can come up with much more interesting ideas that what I've listed here. It's an open book!

## Why do you need a community manager?

Well, Mike and I are extremely busy. We have day jobs, families and personal things that we need to attend to. Then there's all the Fosstodon admin - managing member questions, engaging with the community and a tonne of other stuff - I could go on forever. That doesn't leave time for much else.

Because of this, Mike and I feel like we have been neglecting the Fosstodon community a little recently, and that has to stop. So we put our heads together and decided that having someone dedicated to growing, managing and engaging with the community would be a huge help to us and a massive benefit to Fosstodon in general.

## What's in it for me?

Other than copious amounts of satisfaction from being involved in something awesome and having a seat at the Fosstodon table? Not a lot unfortunately. This would be purely on a volunteer basis, you would be working extremely closely with both Mike and myself to discuss new ideas and how best to implement them.

Oh, you get an @fosstodon.org email address, and we will probably throw some stickers in for you too! :-)

*By the way, if you want to buy some stickers for yourself, [take a look here](/support).*

## How do I apply?

We have created a simple online form to fill in. It should take no more than 5 minutes to complete. That will email us your application. Once we have it, we will review the application, and if we want to move things forward, we will be in touch.

**Applications for the community manager position are now closed.**

If you have any questions about this role, feel free to email both Mike and myself at **mail [at] fosstodon [dot] org**. Or you could just DM us Mastodon.
