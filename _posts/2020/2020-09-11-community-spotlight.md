There's a steady flow of interesting projects and achievements floating around the [Fosstodon Community](https://fosstodon.org/). As such, we thought it would be fun to highlight and put them, here, on the [Fosstodon Hub](https://hub.fosstodon.org/).

We've already reached out to a few community members to gauge their interest and the responses were very positive! While we're waiting on those members to put together some information on their projects, we'd like to extend the offer to the rest of the community.

### What qualifies as a project for the Community Spotlight?

At the moment, we don't have any steadfast or hardline criteria for what would warrant a project highlight. Ideally, we'd like to see something that is FOSS or FOSS-related (although we're not limiting it to that). Examples could include something along the lines of [Ru's](https://fosstodon.org/@celia) Micropub Client or [Yarmo's](https://fosstodon.org/@yarmo) Keyoxide project (both, of which, we'll have more information on, later).

### Who can submit a project for review?

We'd be happy to take suggestions from anyone but, ideally, we'd like to hear from the person that's working on the project since, ultimately, we'll need their permission to share about it. We'll also need that person to provide information to help us better explain what the project is and how it works.

### How can I notify the [Fosstodon Staff](/team) of my project?

That's easy! You can send an email to [mail@fosstodon.org](mailto:mail@fosstodon.org) or just send a direct, group message to [Kev](https://fosstodon.org/@kev), [Mike](https://fosstodon.org/@mike), and [Cooper](https://fosstodon.org/@cooper).

*We can't wait to share about what you've been working on!*
