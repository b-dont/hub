**You know who's awesome?... all of you! Once again, we've been able to help a couple of open source projects, based on your continued [donations](/support) and support for Fosstodon!**<!--more-->

A few weeks ago we [asked](https://hub.fosstodon.org/another-round-of-donations) for your help in deciding which open source projects should receive some Fosstodon love and support. After many submissions and a vote, by our [Patreons](https://www.patreon.com/fosstodon), we finally landed on 2 winners.

We just made a $200.00 donation to [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) and another $200.00 donation to the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/).

Our [about](https://hub.fosstodon.org/about) page contains details about our funding and past donations.

## Your say matters

We've always said that any additional funding we receive from the Fosstodon Community will be used for supporting open source projects. Once we have enough saved up, we ask you to give us some input and vote on a project.

If you're an active Patron, you will get to cast a vote as to which project gets the donation. **If you want to sign up to support Fosstodon and other projects, [you can use this link](https://www.patreon.com/fosstodon).** Our Patreon tiers start at just $1/month.

## Seriously, thanks... and we mean it

You guys are the epitome of what a community should be. At the time of this post, we're right on the brink of 11,000 members and that is an amazing achievement. Our regular [Masto.Host](https://masto.host/) upgrades are a tribute to the Fosstodon Community's success and growth.

**Thanks for your continued support and helping us make sure Fosstodon is one of the best Mastodon instances to be a part of!**
