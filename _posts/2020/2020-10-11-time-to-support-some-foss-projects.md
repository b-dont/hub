Despite the current events, our members have continued to pour out financial support for Fosstodon and we couldn't be more humbled. As we've previously stated, we'll spread the love to open source projects when we've reached a surplus in funding. <!--more-->

With that being said, we're preparing to make 2 donations to a couple of open source projects, in the amount of $200 each. We need our members' input on where to send those donations. [Click here](http://donations.fosstodon.org) to submit your suggestions for projects that you'd like us to support.

We'll stop taking submissions, on 10/25. At that time, our Fosstodon Patreons will vote on those submissions and narrow it down to 2 entries.

If you're interested in having a say on where the donations will go, you can sign up to become a Patreon, [here](https://patreon.com/fosstodon).

A HUGE “thanks!” to all of our current Patreons and other supporters, as we wouldn't be able to do this awesome stuff without you guys! We're proud to have an extremely supportive community and appreciate all of you, more than you know!
