## Fosstodon Team Covenant
v0.1.0-2025-06-19

The Fosstodon team is responsible for the upkeep of Fosstodon. While not all members of the team engage directly in all forms of moderation, all commit to the following:

1. Acknowledge our privileges. Above all else, taking on responsibility for Fosstodon grants us privileges and authority that others do not have. This is a pledge to use our privilege for good.
2. Aim for safety, prioritize those who are vulnerable, and consider impact before intentions. This includes believing people when their own actions show us who they are.
3. Consider our potential for ignorance, and trust those who bring concerns. We will verify before acting, and seek relevant advice when we have doubts.
4. Engage with respect, acknowledge the humanity of all involved, and take the minimum action required to have a positive impact on safety.
5. Bear the burden of criticism, be accountable for mistakes, and commit to meaningful action and change.
6. Moderate and lead with empathy, remember that individuals have different life experiences. Work to learn and let that guide your decisions.
7. Treat all internal discussions, user reports, and moderation decisions with appropriate confidentiality. Respect the privacy and dignity of those involved.

Fosstodon moderation leans towards a one-strike policy before suspension of members.
The exceptions for this are spam, and TOS-violating content including threats to safety, credible or otherwise.

Moderation of remote users may escalate to defederation of their instance, if the instance is a repeat source of abuse or known to federate TOS-violating content.

Continued membership in the Fosstodon team requires acceptance and good-faith cooperation with the spirit of this document and the [Fosstodon Code of Conduct](https://hub.fosstodon.org/coc).

All of us are responsible for holding each of us accountable. We commit to clear, honest, and compassionate communication, especially in moments of disagreement.
