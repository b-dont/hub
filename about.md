# About Us

The whole point of Fosstodon is to be a community of like-minded people who enjoy Free & Open Source Software (FOSS). Running a social network can be expensive, so [we accept donations in various forms](/support). Originally founded by [Kev Quirk](https://fosstodon.org/@kev) and [Mike Stone](https://fosstodon.org/@mike) as a means to have their own presence in the Fediverse, it quickly grew. 

Originially funded out of pocket, Fosstodon grew beyond what Kev and Mike could afford to pay for by themselves. The community has generously donated to allow for Fosstodon to grow. From the very start, we committed to donating any extra money we have available to other open source projects. We want to make sure we are as [transparent as possible](/finances) when it comes to the support we receive from our members.
